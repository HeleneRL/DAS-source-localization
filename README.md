# Specialization Project – Fall 2025
## Source Localization Using Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS)

This repository contains all code implemented and used for the specialization project on source localization using Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS).

**Note:**  
This README and the codebase are still under construction and will be further developed as part of the master’s project in Spring 2026.

---

## Repository Overview

The project focuses on estimating acoustic source locations using DAS data. The raw DAS data is **not** available due to its size mainly. However, intermediate results are provided to allow reproduction of the main processing steps and figures presented in the report.

---

## Reproducing the Results

### 1. Time-of-Arrival (ToA) Detections

Time-of-arrival detections were generated using:

libs/dasprocessor/detection.py


The resulting detections are stored in:

libs/resources/B_4/


### 2. Ellipse Construction

Running either of the following scripts:

libs/dasprocessor/times_to_ellipses.py
libs/dasprocessor/times_to_ellipses_multiline.py


will produce dictionaries containing:
- Ellipse points
- Direction-of-arrival (DoA) information

These outputs are stored in the corresponding folders under:

libs/resources/


Ellipses are constructed around the cable layout defined in:

suspected_cable_layout.json



### 3. Source Position Estimation

Source position estimates are generated by running:

libs/dasprocessor/find_centroids.py


This script computes centroid-based source locations from overlapping ellipses.

---

## Plotting Results

Several plotting scripts are available. The main ones are:

libs/dasprocessor/scripts/plot_map_v2.py
libs/dasprocessor/scripts/plot_qualified_packets.py


### Plotting Qualified Packets

To plot only packets with overlapping ellipses:

1. First run:
libs/dasprocessor/find_valid_packets.py
2. Use its output as input to:

libs/dasprocessor/scripts/plot_qualified_packets.py




## Notes

- All file paths within scripts are not made relative to the repository root yet, be aware.
- Some scripts depend on intermediate results generated by previous processing steps or data that I have locally on my computer.
- The project structure and workflow may change as development continues.
